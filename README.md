# Kanbello

A Trello-like Kanban Board App.

*__NOTE__: This app is still in its infancy, expect bugs large and small. If you spot a bug please report it by opening an issue.*

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone git@github.com:matrixersp/kanbello.git
cd kanbello
npm install
npm start
```

*__NOTE__: for now the [backend server](https://github.com/matrixersp/kanbello-api) needs to be running, in addition you need MongoDB to be installed locally and also you need to manually create a board and replace the id in `src/app/appSlice.js`.
This will change soon.*
