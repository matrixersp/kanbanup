# KanbanUp

A Trello-like Kanban Board App.

*__NOTE__: This app is still in its infancy, expect bugs large and small. If you spot a bug please report it by opening an issue.*

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone git@github.com:matrixersp/kanbanup.git
cd kanbanup
npm install
npm start
```

*__NOTE__: for now the [backend server](https://github.com/matrixersp/kanbanup-api) needs to be running, in addition you need MongoDB to be installed locally.*
